## Introduction
Hey folks, my name's Bag of Tips, commonly known online as ProStashio (Pro).

I would still consider myself fairly new to the TTRPG world, as I started playing roughly five years ago, jumping straight in as a player in one campaign, and running my own as a GM at the same time. During this time, I have spent a lot of time reading, watching and talking to other game masters, learning all I can to better myself and my games. However, when it came to either being a player or running my own games, there was always one thing that always frustrated me, and that was taking notes.

I went through various ways to take my notes, such as Word or Google Docs. I also tried OneNote and various websites. However, none of them fit what I was wanting from my note taking tool and so I was left looking for something else. Then one day I stumbled upon a video for Obsidian, a tool that allowed me to create notes and organise them by linking as well as making them look nice with various plugins and markdown. After delving further, I found that there was a large TTRPG community, and with it, various plugins that were being developed to aid us in making our games even better.

And from there, I was hooked. I found this amazing tool that allowed me to work how I wanted. Allowing me to organising my notes how I wished and not being limited to set boxes and parameters that a web site had set for me. Additionally, the community of developers we have working within the TTRPG community also meant we had a lot of powerful tools to aid us in our work. So I spent a lot of time developing my own notes, discovering different ways to do things, finding ways that they shouldn't be done, talking with members of the community and the fountain of knowledge they held, and overall just experimenting and having fun with it.

After a while, I started to show my notes and my templates, as many people were asking questions on how I did certain things. Whilst they weren't perfect, I would always share them to give people ideas on what they could do. After this gained more and more interest, I decided to start making YouTube videos to show people the work I've done and to give a better showcase of what they can do. However, not long after this, I didn't feel like the templates I were giving were up to scratch and could be better. So, it was at this time I decided to leave the ones that I had made without too much thought for free for access and started focusing deeply on the ones you see today. The ones where I put a lot of time and effort thinking about the techniques, methodology of how notes come together, and how we actually use them as game masters.

Things were going great. I had moved on to university where I am currently studying to be a games designer and continuing my work within obsidian. We were using the tools we had access to, and we're making interesting and useful templates. However, as time went on, due to our complications with plugins being left behind and not being updated. We found ourselves in a place where we had to either put up with bugs, or make an entirely new system. And so, that's what you have here in front of you, my 2.0 version of my template vault.

Over the years, learning and playing TTRPGs I found a passion for sharing what I know and helping others in finding ways that work for them. That's very much what I'm a part of now, within the TTRPG community. Offering my work to those interested, and lending an ear to those that need any inspiration. Now, with the release of version 2.0 and the work done setting the stage for the next part of this obsidian vault journey. I find myself moving on to other ventures. If you're interested in hearing what I have to say or want to gain any insight from my experiences, then please come and watch my youtube videos, check out my Ko-fi, as well as join the Discord.

If you want to get involved in these creations, and improving our games together, come say hi! Until then however, I hope you enjoy my TTRPG template vault. I hope it brings value to you, your players and your games.

## Overview
This vault is designed to house all of your notes for your TTRPG world. And when I say notes, I mean information about your characters, such as their names, locations, interest, desires, etc. But I have not made any effort to make any systems for monsters or game rules. This is something you may add yourself in your own personal vaults. However, it is not the main goal of this vault. My personal methodology is to keep the game separate from my notes, so I tend to keep all my player sheets, monster stat blocks and items within my virtual tabletop of choice. However, many people choose to bring all this information into their personal vaults, and many have great success with that. It all comes down to personal preference.

The main goal of this vault is to make creating notes as simple and as easy as possible. So you can spend less time worrying about organisation and making your notes easy to read. And more time actually building up your world and putting time to where it counts. With that being said, depending on your views going into this vault, you may find some things are lacking, such as characters, stats and abilities. This is because I am focusing purely on the notes rather than the system.

However, this is now your vault! So do with it as you please. Feel free to put in all your game system information if you so wish, and change the templates to your preference. There's nothing stopping you now to making this vault your own.

## FAQ / Tips

### Where do I start?
So for a new user picking this up for the first time, everything might be a little overwhelming, as you don't know where to begin and that's completely understandable. Firstly, I recommend reading through the entirety of this README as well as exploring the Templates as you do so. Doing this, you can start to see how everything works. However, I recommend not changing anything within the templates themselves until you are confident you want them to be changed. To start playing around with the notes you'll want to create a new note for the template you want to mess around in, such as an npc. This can be accessed through [[Buttons]].

Once you're confident you have a grasp on the basics, I recommend starting at the highest point for your campaign or one-shot. By that, I mean the locations. If your one-shot is taking place in a town, you'll probably want to have the town, the geography that it's located in, and then maybe the planet just so you have the name of the planet. Whilst creating the planet new might sound like a lot for just a one-shot. All this is doing is making a note as a placeholder for all of this information. It's simply going to have a name we put in and that's it. From there we just do the same with the geography, And then we move down to the settlement, where we can start fleshing it out with all the NPCs, Locations, etc.

### How do I creating a new note?
<u>Option A:</u> Add a new note by using 'CTRL + Q'. You can now select a template to use and it will automatically be added into the correct folder for you. (You are more than welcome to edit them, but will need to edit the settings.)
<u>Option B:</u> Use the buttons on the right hand side tab. (You are more than welcome to edit them, but will need to edit the settings.)

### How do I Search?
Using CTRL + SHIFT + F, or In the top left, use the üîç or üè∑Ô∏è buttons to search for anything you're looking for. All notes have tags to increase the power of this vault. All characters such as Players, NPCs and Deities have the ""#Character" tag. All locations like Settlements, Shops, etc. all have the ""#Location" tag, and so on. Some notes get broken down further such as NPCs with the ""#NPC" tag. Additionally, if you want to search for a NPC you know is in a certain settlement. Search for the Tag: ""#NPC" tag and the Property: 'location'. I recommend looking at the templates and see which notes have what tags to aid in your searching.

### What is the order of locations?

#### Plane
The planes will house all the information for the various planes within your table top rpg world. Depending on your setting, this could be different, but in broad terms, in D&D, this would be your Material plane, plane of fire or water, or the nine hells. If running a sci-fi game, this could be renamed to Galaxy to house the Galaxy that you're playing in.

#### Planet
Planets were house all the information needed for. your planets. This gives you a broad idea of all the countries, locations and characters within.

#### Geography
The geography is the land masses within your planet. Also known as continents. For a real world example, one geography would be Great Britain and another would be Ireland. Within Great Britain we have the Country Organizations of England, Scotland and Wales. Within Ireland, we have the Country Organizations of England and Ireland.

The reason why these are in a geography note rather than a country note is because land can change ownership over time. So for example, if we had England within our TTRPG world and England went to war with Ireland and took over Northern Ireland, we would then have to adjust our entire note for England and change the map that it covered. Instead, we have landmasses within a geography note so this means that we can keep the geography separate and have countries in an organisation note.

![[GeographyExample.png]]

#### County
A county is a subsection of a overarching geography. For a real world example in England, you have counties such as Staffordshire, Essex and North Yorkshire. If you would like to go bigger with a TTRPG land, with examples such as the states of Texas, California or Kansas. You might want to make a new template for States and then place counties within those.

![[StateOfCalifornia.png]]

#### Settlement
A settlement is for all of your towns and cities within your campaign. These will house most of your shops and point of interest and characters.

#### District
Districts allow you to break down your settlement further into various districts. This could be residential, industrial or even commercial districts which allow you to further expand your settlement and allows you to organise your notes how you wish. This is very much an optional template for you to use.

#### Point of Interest
The point of interest is a very universal template that you can use template in essentially any location. This template is great for any shops or important buildings within a settlement, but it can also be used for landmarks such as mountains and volcanoes within your geography and counties.

### Help! Plugins aren't working!
Make sure when you extracted the folder, you didn't have a folder within a folder. The file path should be `C:\Documents > Obsidian Vaults > TTRPG Templates 2.0` or something similar, depending on where you have put it. Then, within it should look like this:

![[FilePath.png]]

### Buttons tab broken?
If you just see something like <font color="#d83931"><font color="#ff0000">BUTTON[New-NPC]</font></font> in the buttons tab on the right hand side, just use L CTRL + P and type 'Reload'. Select Reload App Without Saving and it will resolve the issue. This only seems to happen during the initial creation of the Vault.

### Can you add ... from this specific TTRPG system?
More often than not the answer is no. This is simply because this vault is designed to be primarily for notes only. You may notice that I have some items in here which are specifically for Pf2e, but that's simply because that is a system I'm running on, and it just gives us a foundation to work from. If you're wanting to add your own races, items, creatures, etc, you will have to do that work yourself. Same goes for any kind of gameplay system such as a. character sheet or a calculator for experience.

### How do I make a Player Character Sheet that tracks my players Stats, Inventory, AC, etc?
Just don't, that's my advice. Over the years of working with Obsidian, I have seen many people try to create character sheets. Each have their own various levels of success, but ultimately at the end I see them all fail. What we're doing here in Obsidian, is already pushing the limits to how this program works. If you want to have a constant project of where you are having to maintain, fix bug, etc, for your character cheat then by all means, go for it. Not to mention going through each character every session to update these notes. I personally say a game master has way too much on their plate already. Let alone having to double up the workload of maintaining a character sheet when players they should be doing that themselves.

However, there's a reason why companies such as D&D Beyond have a have an entire team dedicated to making these systems. Because, they're very complex and break and need constant adjustment and changing. My advice is to keep the vaults as for pure notes and to use website with teams dedicated to doing this for you.

### Where is ... Template?
Depending on what template you're referring to, there's one of three answers. Either it's being worked on behind the scenes and will be released further down the line. If this is the case, I usually have a placeholder folder ready for it. So if you see a folder within the vault, but no template, that's the reason why. However, maybe it's something that I'm not going to be working on. Or, its something that I haven't thought of yet.

### Why is the Lore folder empty?
Currently I don't have any plans to include anything in here. This folder is completely up to you on how you utilise it to house all of your history and various other bits of lore within your setting.

### Why do I have to add ... twice?
You may find that you need to assign a note to another note twice. Once in itself, and once in the note you're linking it to. The reason for this is simply because we're limited to simplicity. By all means, this is something that could be fixed. However, we would then have to start moving into Java script. I have made the decision to keep this vault as simple as possible so anyone can pick this up and start using it. So adding Java script into this vault is just not an option. If this is something you want to look into and adapt into your own personal vault for this, then by all means do so. But it's not something I not will be adding into the main vault for everyone else.

### Why does it break when I move the templates into my old vault?
The reason for this is because the templates are only one part of this vault. The other side of this vault is the plugins and all the settings alongside them. Whilst you're able to move notes over from this vault to an older vault, I do recommend using this vault as the primary as all the settings and templates have been set up correctly. However, if you would like to use an older vault, you will need to look through the settings and make sure those are set correctly yourself.

### Audio Files
Sadly, audio files within Obsidian don't seem to have much support, to the point where we can't automate where their created nor can we select them with Meta-bind. So when playing with audio files, you'll need to move these into the Z_Audio folder to keep them organised as well as well as manually reference them within your notes when needed.

### I found an Issue
Well, bugger. I must have missed something. Not a problem. Feel free to pop over into the Discord and let me know!

### Don't want things to break?
Like any piece of software, with updates, comes new bugs and breakages. This usually means someone needs to come through and edit and update certain settings or templates. If you don't want the hassle of updating and fixing any issues that may arise from each update, you might want to consider keeping the automatic updates turned off so your vault will always stay working. This can be found in Settings>General. However, do note that this means you won't be able to access any new content that may come along with both official and community plugin updates.

![[AutomaticUpdates.png]]

### Better Time-Saving Tempaltes
Depending on your setting or how you like to work, you may want to set options within your templates, so they're ready for you to use straight away. For example, any NPC that you make might for the most-part be unmet. So you might want to consider setting that within the template. Other examples could be Healthy, or their language as Common.

## Breakdown

### Useful Notes

#### [[Vault Hub]] 
The Vault Hub is a place that you can keep coming back to to help you manage your campaign. I have given you the basics of showing your active parties as well as a place to house a random note selector to prompt you to help you fleshing out your world. However, this is a note that can very easily. be changed to your preferences.

#### [[Buttons]]
The buttons note, which is located on the right hand side in a tab, is a place of quick access where you can quickly and easily create new notes which get automatically sorted within their relevant folders. With some templates, you may be asked which folder you want to place it in. This is usually so you can place it in a folder which is named for a certain party to keep things organised.

#### [[Tab of Lazy Prep]]
The Tab of Lazy Prep note is another way you can prep for your games. This is based off the methodology of the [Lazy DM](https://slyflourish.com/the_lazy_dungeon_master_cc.html) guide where you can very easily note down any key bits of information, scenes, characters, and anything else that you may need for a session. It also gives you a place to add some backup notes, so if your players do something completely random, you can always have something on-hand.

#### [[Notepad]]
The Notepad note is very simply a place where you can note down anything quickly, such as a random quest idea as well as sorting out any short and long term goals that you may need to get to.

#### [[Websites]] 
The Websites note is designed for those who wish to work completely from Obsidian, giving you the ability to access various websites and generators to help you fill out your game. I have given you some examples of what I use. However, you are more than welcome to change this to your preference.

### Templates

#### [[Template - Session Note]]
##### Metadata
- **Tags:** Tags are what we use to reference our notes in many cases. We use tags to define notes such as characters. They are especially useful for when we want to refine our search. For example, an NPC is a character and a player is a character. An NPC would have both tags, '#NPC' and '#Character' and a player would have tags of '#Player' and '#Character'. So if we need to find all of our characters, we can search the tag '#Character', or if we just want to find our players, we could search for the tag '#Player'. Additionally we use this tag to add the various emoticons and colours to our notes.
- **Aliases:** Aliases are what we use to call a note by another name. For example, this could be a character who is known by one name, but has various nicknames. This could also be used for If you have something like a race that goes by multiple names, this could be a dark elf, also known as a Drow.

#### Core Search Assistant
The core search assistant plugin enhances the built in search functionality by providing keyboard interfaces, card view, bigger previews and even auto previews when searching.

#### Custom File Explorer sorting
The custom file explorer sorting allows us to sort our notes how we want them without having to worry about how we spell our note titles.

#### Custom Frames
Custom framed is a plugin that allows us to advance on the iframes we have access to within Obsidian. They allow us to do additional things, such as lock into our accounts whilst using obsidian.
 - Custom Frames are missing a feature to go back once you go to another page. So if you ever get stuck, use the reload button above. 
 - These Websites are great if you want some quick things like a name for an NPC. If you want to get more detailed with things like the map generators, I recommend opening in the web page so you don't lose any work.
 - Please be advised that, when adding a site as a custom frame, you potentially expose personal information you enter to other plugins you have installed. For more information, see [this discussion](https://github.com/Ellpeck/ObsidianCustomFrames/issues/54#issuecomment-1210879685).

#### Dataview
Dataview is one of the backbone plugins that allow us to do some amazing things within this Vault. Simply put, Dataview allows us to search through our vault to find the relevant information that we need, such as when we are. looking for what characters are within a settlement. Data view is what allows us to call that information and displays it for us within our note.

#### Default New Tab Page
Default New Tab Page allows us to set a default page that opens when we open a new tab. For this vault, I have set it to our vault hub

#### Dice Roller
The Dice Roller plugin gives us the ability to roll dice within our notes. This can either be done within the tab on the right hand side, or this can be built in within our notes.

#### Editing Toolbar
The Editing Toolbar gives us a toolbar at the top of our screen when editing our notes, which allows us to have quick access to some functionality without needing to memorise all of the markdown to accomplish things such as underlining, highlighting and cantering.

#### Excalidraw
The Excalidraw plugin allows us to have some visual notes within our vault. It allows us to display images, use arrows to point to various things, and allows us to create things like mind-maps as well as mood boards.

#### File Color
The file colour plugin allows us to colour files. (Who would have thought!)

#### Hover Editor
The Hover Editor allows us to hover our mouse over a link within our note and after a couple seconds we'll display it in a pop up tab.

#### Meta Bind Plugin
The Metabind plugin is one of the other major backbones within this vault. This is the plugin that allows us to find various notes that we define, such as characters as well as calling images and having access to drop down selections that we can use to quickly and easily make notes. Please note that I actually use meta-bind in a very simple way. In the grand scheme of inks, but metabound is a very powerful tool. And could be used in a much more complex way if you wish to look further into this.

#### Obsidian Leaflet
The Obsidian Leaflet plug in allows us to bring in images and use them as maps within our games.

#### QuickAdd
The QuickAdd plugin is one of a few plugins that allows us to quickly and easily create a new note and puts it in a defined folder.

#### Style Settings
Style Settings gives us the ability to edit a bunch of different things within our vault. It gives us the ability to edit our appearance within our vault, as well as editing some plugins such as the Supercharge Links

#### Supercharged Links
The Supercharged Links plugin allows us to colour and even add various emojis and formatting to our notes.

#### Templater
Templater is one of the other major plugins we use to create notes from our buttons.

#### Various Complements
Various compliments is just that, It gives us various compliments within our vault, such as auto completing and suggesting links when we're typing out our notes.

### CSS

#### Banner Fade
They're cool snippet. I found that allows us to have cool backgrounds within our notes that fade out as you go further down in the note.

#### Better Leaflet Icons
 Better leave for icons gives us better-looking icons within our obsidian leaflets. The design I went for here is based off Skyrim point of interest icon. This was Originally created by myself, but was vastly improved with the help of sailKite.

#### Supercharged Links Gen
This is created by the Supercharge links to howls all of that information.

#### BOT Callouts
This is a collection of Bag of Tips' callouts that are used within this vault.
